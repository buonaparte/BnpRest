# Best Practices

This section will show you various best practices that I've learn while writing several REST API, using ZfrRest.

## Be pragmatic

I know a lot of people will disagree with that, but you should be pragmatic when using your API. HATEOAS is nice,
but it's actually not really needed (whenever I use an API, I never ever used the URL attributes of such APIs,
because the workflow of which method to call is usually known in advance).

If being 100% REST compliant takes too much time or is not useful for your use case, don't lose time on that and
go on.

[This link](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api) contains a lot of best practices
when designing an API.

## Use nested URIs

ZfrRest allows you to nest URLs, for accessing the same resource based on different contexts. For instance, if you
have tweets, you can either access all tweets (`/tweets`) but also access all tweets from a given user (`/users/1/tweets`).

With the template feature of ZfrRest, you do not have to write rendering code multiple times. Instead, you will use
the exact same template for the two cases, except with different set of data.

## List and resource controllers

You have to understand that you will typically have two controllers per resource: the list controller and the
item controller. You should have a coherent naming that you use throughout your application (for instance you
could add the `List` word for list controllers: `TweetController` and `TweetListController`).

This table will recap you the type of controller based on URI and verb:

URI | Verb | Type
------------ | ------------- | ------------
/tweets | POST  | List controller
/tweets | GET  | List controller
/tweets | PUT  | N/A
/tweets | DELETE  | N/A
/tweets/1 | POST | N/A
/tweets/1 | GET | Item controller
/tweets/1 | PUT | Item controller
/tweets/1 | DELETE | Item controller

## Simplify your controllers

Controllers are known to be hard to test (you have to mock requests...). Instead, all your controllers must be kept
very simple. To do that, you should use a service layer. In ZfrRest, here is how your controller typically look like.

* List controller

```php
class TweetListController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    private $tweetService;

    public function __construct(TweetService $tweetService)
    {
        $this->tweetService = $tweetService;
    }

    /**
     * Create a new tweet
     */
    public function post()
    {
        $data  = $this->validateIncomingData(TweetInputFilter::class);
        $tweet = $this->hydrateObject(TweetHydrator::class, new Tweet(), $data);

        $tweet = $this->tweetService->create($tweet);

        return new ResourceViewModel(['tweet' => $tweet], ['template' => 'tweets/tweet']);
    }

    /**
     * Get all the tweets
     */
    public function get()
    {
        // Assuming getAll return a paginator
        $tweets = $this->tweetService->getAll();
        $tweets->setCurrentPageNumber($this->params()->fromQuery('page', 1);

        return new ResourceViewModel(['tweets' => $tweets], ['template' => 'tweets']);
    }
}
```

* Item controller

```php
class TweetController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    private $tweetService;

    public function __construct(TweetService $tweetService)
    {
        $this->tweetService = $tweetService;
    }

    /**
     * Get an existing tweet
     */
    public function get(array $params)
    {
        if (!$tweet = $this->tweetService->getById($params['tweet_id'])) {
            throw new NotFoundException();
        }

        return new ResourceViewModel(['tweet' => $tweet], ['template' => 'tweets/tweet']);
    }

    /**
     * Update an existing tweet
     */
    public function put(array $params)
    {
        if (!$tweet = $this->tweetService->getById($params['tweet_id'])) {
            throw new NotFoundException();
        }

        $data  = $this->validateIncomingData(TweetInputFilter::class);
        $tweet = $this->hydrateObject(TweetHydrator::class, $tweet, $data);

        $tweet = $this->tweetService->update($tweet);

        return new ResourceViewModel(['tweet' => $tweet], ['template' => 'tweets/tweet']);
    }

    /**
     * Delete an existing tweet
     */
    public function delete(array $params)
    {
        if (!$tweet = $this->tweetService->getById($params['tweet_id'])) {
            throw new NotFoundException();
        }

        $this->tweetService->delete($tweet);

        return new JsonModel();
    }
}
```

## Paginate data

To paginate data, you need to create an instance of `Zend\Paginator\Paginator`. DoctrineModule and DoctrineORMModule
offers two adapters for Doctrine, that you can use depending on the use case: `DoctrineModule\Paginator\Adapter\Selectable`
and `DoctrineORMModule\Paginator\Adapter\DoctrinePaginator`.

We recommend you to create the paginator in your repositories (or your services). Two cases can happen:

1. If you do not need a custom query (for instance if you only want to fetch the tweets, without any join or whatever),
you can use the `Selectable` adapter, because repositories implement the `Selectable` interface. For instance, in your
service:

```php
use DoctrineModule\Paginator\Adapter\Selectable as SelectableAdapter;
use Zend\Paginator\Paginator;

class TweetService
{
    private $tweetRepository;

    public function getAll()
    {
        return new Paginator(new SelectableAdapter($this->tweetRepository));
    }
}
```

> You can optionally pass a criteria object for filtering, as we'll see later.

2. If you need custom query, this approach is not flexible enough. We recommend you in this case to create a
custom repository, that will create the query, and wrap it under a paginator:

First, your service now delegate to the repository:

```php
class TweetService
{
    private $tweetRepository;

    public function getAll()
    {
        return new $this->tweetRepository->findAll();
    }
}
```

While your TweetRepository create the custom query, and wrap it around a Paginator:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Pagination\Paginator as DoctrinePaginator;
use DoctrineORMModule\Paginator\Adapter\DoctrinePaginator as DoctrinePaginatorAdapter;
use Zend\Paginator\Paginator;

class TweetRepository extends EntityRepository
{
    public function findAll()
    {
        $queryBuilder = $this->createQueryBuilder('tweet');
        $queryBuilder->select('author')
                     ->join('tweet.author', 'author');

        $doctrinePaginator = new DoctrinePaginator($queryBuilder);
        return new Paginator(new DoctrinePaginatorAdapter($doctrinePaginator));
    }
}
```

## Filtering data

When retrieving data, you will often need to filter the result set through query parameters. One approach to do
that is to extract the query params right into your controllers, and passing each filters to your service, which
in turn will do the right query.

However, we definitely do not want to tie your controller to query params parsing. Once again, two cases can happen:

* You have simple filtering needs, when you only need to filter the fields of the entity you are fetching (for instance,
filtering by first name, last name or age when retrieving a list of users).
* You have more complex filtering needs, when you can possibly also filter by properties of associations (for instance,
you want to filter by author first name when retrieving a list of tweets).

### Simple filtering

For filtering fields on the same entity, you can use a Criteria object. The Criteria object is a Doctrine abstraction
that allows to filtering collections (it also works on repository) efficiently. For instance, let's say you want
to filter users by first name and last name. To do that, you allow `first_name` and `last_name` query params:

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Criteria;

class UserListController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    private $userService;

    public function get()
    {
        // Get all the query params
        $queryParams = $this->params()->fromQuery();

        // Create the criteria object
        $criteria = new Criteria();
        $builder  = $criteria->expr();

        foreach ($queryParams as $key => $value) {
            switch ($key) {
                case 'first_name':
                    $criteria->andWhere($builder->eq('firstName', $value));
                    break;

                case 'last_name':
                    $criteria->andWhere($builder->eq('lastName', $value));
                    break;
            }
        }

        $users = $this->userService->getAllByCriteria($criteria);

        return new ResourceViewModel(['users' => $users]);
    }
}
```

With your `getAllByCriteria` creating a paginator, but with the Criteria object to further filtering the data set:

```php
use DoctrineModule\Paginator\Adapter\Selectable as SelectableAdapter;
use Zend\Paginator\Paginator;

class UserService
{
    private $userRepository;

    public function getAllByCriteria(Criteria $criteria)
    {
        return new Paginator(new SelectableAdapter($this->tweetRepository, $criteria));
    }
}
```

> As you can see, we can easily combine filtering and pagination thanks to the power of the Criteria API!

However, there is a problem with this approach: our controller is now polluted with code that is difficult to
test in isolation, and cannot be reused elsewhere. To solve this problem, we introduce a new kind of objects: the
Criteria objects.

Those objects simply extend the base Criteria, but know how to build the criteria object. For instance, here is
a UserCriteria object:

```php
class UserCriteria extends Criteria
{
    public function __construct(array $filters = [])
    {
        $builder = $this->expr();

        foreach ($queryParams as $key => $value) {
            switch ($key) {
                case 'first_name':
                    $this->andWhere($builder->eq('firstName', $value));
                    break;

                case 'last_name':
                    $this->andWhere($builder->eq('lastName', $value));
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Your controller now become:

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Criteria;

class UserListController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    private $userService;

    public function get()
    {
        $criteria = new UserCriteria($this->params()->fromQuery(null, []));
        $users    = $this->userService->getAllByCriteria($criteria);

        return new ResourceViewModel(['users' => $users]);
    }
}
```

Much cleaner!

### Complex filtering

This works well when filtering on fields that belong to the entity. However, the Criteria API is a rather limited API,
and does not allow things such as filtering on association using joins. We therefore need to resolve to a similar
approach, but without using the Criteria API itself.
