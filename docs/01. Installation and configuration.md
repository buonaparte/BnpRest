# Installation and Configuration

Starting from ZfrRest 0.4.*, ZfrRest has very few options. Once you have retrieved it from Composer, all the
available options can be configured by copying the `zfr_rest.global.php.dist` file into your `config/autoload` folder.

Here are the possible options:

* `exception_map`: allows to map an exception to a ZfrRest exception. It will automatically be catched by the listener
and create an appropriate JSON response. You can learn more about error handling [in this section](/docs/01. Installation and configuration.md).
* `register_http_method_override_listener`: in some companies, or if you are using standard HTML forms, you can be
limited in the choice of HTTP verbs (most of the time, only POST and GET). By enabling this option, you can now send
a header `X-HTTP-Method-Override` whose value is the HTTP method. ZfrRest will automatically replace the verb of the
request.
